  "mainParagraph": "The piece, commisioned by the popular Spanish band <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/axolotes_mexicanos/?hl=es\">Axolotes Mexicanos</a>, tells a whimsical story about a girl who falls in love with a nonchalant octopus from outer space and her obsessive, one-sided quest to win its affection. The narrative explores themes of desire and emotional vulnerability through a playful, cute lens, blending dark undertones with charming humor.

  "expParagraph": "This immersive journey explores the fragile edges of consciousness and memory in the afterlife, blending <span class=\"destacado\">photogrammetry</span> with <span class=\"destacado\">procedural deformation</span> to create a space that feels both intimately known and deeply wrong. After dying with no extra lives left, you drift through the places you once visited most as your memories unravel, the world distorts, the music decays into static, and reality slowly becomes unrecognizable. <br> This interactive experience was developed in <span class=\"destacado\">Unity</span> and the environments were created using <span class=\"destacado\">Blender</span> and <span class=\"destacado\">photogrammetry techniques.</span>",
