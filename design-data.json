  "beforeRedesign": "Before the redesign, the <span class='destacado'>Complutense University of Madrid Information Service</span> had a <span class='destacado'>fragmented visual identity</span>, with inconsistent styles and a hard-to-read logo. The brand guidelines were unclear, and the website suffered from poor navigation, visual clutter, and inconsistent design. Social media content lacked coherence and adaptation to each platform, while brand materials showed technical errors and inconsistency. <span class='destacado'>Limited budget and non-specialized staff</span> made it urgent to develop a more <span class='destacado'>sustainable, accessible, and professional communication system.</span>",
  "logoParagraph": "The logo uses a puzzle-piece metaphor to represent the <span class='destacado'>connection of ideas.</span> The letters “C” and “I” interact playfully, forming either two characters or a single smiling face through Gestalt closure. The filled and outlined forms reflect the <span class='destacado'>diversity of the audience.</span>",

The brief was to create a  <span class='destacado'>trendy accessory that was affordable to produce, durable, and high-quality, with strong viral potential.</span> I developed the Damned Babys: phone holders that attach to the back of the device.

They are also highly Instagrammable, as they are integrated into everyday items such as phones or bags. In addition, both are sold in <span class='destacado'>surprise boxes</span>, a key factor in building anticipation and driving their success. Damned Baby was created under those main principles.",
  "damnedProcessParagraph": "Once the sketch was approved by the brand, I began modeling the design in 3D and contacting toy manufacturers. However, <span class='destacado'>the production quotes we received were over budget.</span> <br>To solve this, I chose to 3D print the design in order to create silicone molds and produce resin casts of the figure. These were then airbrushed and hand-painted, as shown.<br> <span class='destacado'>This approach significantly reduced production costs and made the release highly profitable.</span> Additionally, <span class='destacado'>the hand-painted finish added extra value to the product</span> and that was reflected in the public's response, <span class='destacado'>selling out the product in under a week.</span>",
